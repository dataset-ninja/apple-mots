**Dataset for benchmarking Multiple Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) in an apple orchard field.** is a dataset for instance segmentation, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry. 



The dataset consists of 2198 images with 105559 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*apple*).

Images in the Apple orchard field MOTS dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *testing* (1051 images) and *train* (1147 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
